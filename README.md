## Basic Details
### Team Name: [BeeTechie]


### Team Members

### Project Description
[Hub for Pointless Intelligence]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Can we build a collection of technically functional, aesthetically engaging, and absolutely unnecessary web tools that challenge the conventional idea that every application must solve a 'real' problem?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[WhyTho is a web-based platform featuring a suite of humorous, technically polished micro-apps that offer creative, interactive experiences with no real-world necessity‚Äîonly curiosity, satire, and joy]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ‚Äì for frontend design and interactivity
   Python ‚Äì for backend logic and API development]
- [Flask ‚Äì lightweight Python web framework for backend API
   Bootstrap (optional, if used) ‚Äì for responsive frontend UI components]
- [Flask-CORS ‚Äì to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing between frontend and backend
   smtplib and email.message ‚Äì for email delivery in apps like TellTime
   random, datetime ‚Äì for generating random responses or fetching current time]
- [VS Code ‚Äì for coding and debugging
   Git & GitHub ‚Äì for version control and collaboration
   Python Virtual Environment ‚Äì for dependency isolation
   Postman ‚Äì for API testing (if applicable)
   Browser Developer Tools ‚Äì for frontend debugging
   GitHub Pages / Local Server ‚Äì for hosting frontend]

For Hardware:
- [List main components]
- [List specifications]
- [List tools required]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:
git clone https://whytho-project.vercel.app/
Then navigate into the project directory:
cd WhyTho

Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to manage dependencies:

For macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install flask flask-cors

Configure environment variables (such as email address and app password) directly in app.py, or preferably by using a .env file with secure values if you want to avoid hardcoding credentials. ]

# Run
[# 1. Clone the repository (if not done yet)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/why-tho-web.git
cd why-tho-web

# 2. Backend Setup (TellTime)
cd telltime-backend
pip install flask flask-cors

# 3. Run the Flask backend
python app.py

# 4. Frontend
# Open a new terminal/tab and navigate to the frontend folder (if separate):
cd ../telltime-frontend
# Or if inside the main project:
# Use a live server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code)
# OR open index.html manually in a browser

# Optional: Serve with Python (if needed)
# python -m http.server 5500

# Your site should now be accessible:
# Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
# Backend API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/send
